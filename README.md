# Visual Studio OmniSearch Concept
*A single unified search box for navigation and invocation of VS features*

## Introduction

Visual Studio has 16 distinct search boxes, each of which has varying levels of search accuracy, and a limited breadth.
This project is a crude proof of concept of an all encompassing search box that is intended to demonstrate how a single
box could conceivably act as a code search, discoverability mechanism, and user education tool.

## State of the Project

This project is 'demoable' but not 'usable' and is unlikely to be maintained. Use at your own risk.

## Building

This project has no special build magic. Simply clone the repo, build, and run with Visual Studio 2017 15.7 or later.
